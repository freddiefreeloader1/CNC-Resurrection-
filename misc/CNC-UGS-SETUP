To set up the UGS start with downlading the ugs from https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/
For linux users, you might need to open the serial port from terminal. To do that, write this code to the terminal:
--sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
PLEASE NOTE THAT SETTINGS OF GRBL HAS ALREADY WRITTEN ON ARDUINO UNO. CHECK THE SETTINGS BEFORE CHANGING IT.
After connecting the GRBL arduino to the UGS, setup vizard parameters are as follows:
--Reverse X direction
--All axes have same step size 800pulse/min
After doing the settings you can start using the CNC milling machine. Enjoy!
While using the milling machine, do not set feed more than 100mm/min because, stepper motors cannot catch faster feed rates than that.
