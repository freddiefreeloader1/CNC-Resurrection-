# CNC-Resurrection
ME462 Term Project 

Main goals:
- Create a generic controller for the out of order CNC machines
- Come up with a ROS2 based universal remote handwheel/controller, mainly for the CNC's, but it should be applicable for other uses as well

Stepper Pairs:
-Pins BH and Pins DF

CNC Milling Machine Specs:

-Pitch of the lead screws : 1mm
UGS Parameters:
-Step size of axes : 800pulse/mm
-Max Travel Rate : 150
Do not increase feed rate more than 100mm/min. It staggers motors because motors cannot catch that pulse speed.

REMOTE CONTROLLER DOCUMENTATION:

The Remote Controller project is an innovative and versatile solution designed to provide enhanced control and convenience for various applications. With a range of functional features, this project offers a seamless remote control experience for different devices and systems.

The centerpiece of the Remote Controller project is the GC9A01 round LCD display, which serves as the primary interface. This high-resolution display showcases a user-friendly menu system and subfunctions, allowing users to navigate through different options and select desired actions with ease.

The project currently supports two main subfunctions: CNC and CNC precision. However, the system is highly configurable, enabling the addition of more functions based on individual requirements. This flexibility ensures that the Remote Controller can be adapted to various use cases and applications.

The hardware components of the Remote Controller include a joystick, knob, and three buttons. These components are programmable, allowing users to assign specific functions to perform desired actions. The joystick provides directional control, while the knob allows for precise adjustments. The buttons offer additional input options for quick and convenient operations.

To facilitate seamless communication and integration, all data generated by the joystick, knob, and buttons are transmitted through a socket connection. This connection allows the Remote Controller to interface with other devices or systems, enabling remote control capabilities.

The data received through the socket connection is then sent via a socket-to-ROS2 bridge to a ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) node. ROS2 provides a robust and flexible framework for managing the control and communication of robotic systems. The Remote Controller project leverages ROS2 to enable efficient data transfer, control, and coordination with other ROS2-enabled devices and modules.

For CNC operations, the Remote Controller project supports GRBL with Arduino. The data received through the socket connection is further forwarded to an Arduino board via serial communication, which interfaces with the GRBL software. This setup allows for precise control over three-axis stepper motors using the knob and joystick inputs, making it an ideal solution for CNC applications.

Powering the Remote Controller is a rechargeable 3.7V battery, providing a portable and convenient power source. The battery can be easily recharged using a micro USB connection through a charge module, ensuring uninterrupted operation. Additionally, a slider switch is incorporated, allowing users to power the controller on and off with ease, preserving battery life when not in use.

The GC9A01 round LCD display provides essential information, including the battery percentage and the position of the knob. This real-time feedback ensures users are aware of the remaining battery power and provides visual cues during operations.

The Remote Controller project offers a comprehensive solution for remote control applications. With its versatile interface, programmable components, seamless integration with ROS2, and support for CNC operations, this project enhances control and convenience across a wide range of devices and systems, providing an exceptional remote control experience.


How To Configure The Remote Controller:

1- There is an opening at the side of the controller that you can connect the Pi Pico W to PC and configure the main.py

2- In main.py, to configure the menu, you can change functions named other2, other3 to suit your needs. You can change the format of the messages sent there. 

3- You also need the to configure the ros2 node. Currently the publisher_member_function only supports the CNC applications. To change it, you need to delete all the code that has serial send in it. You should write your own parsing code for the customized messages you have written in step 2.
